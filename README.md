# Keysmash

Keysmash is a fast-paced game where you need to match the random characters displayed on the screen by pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard. The game gets progressively faster as you continue playing, making it more challenging and exciting.

The reason I created the game was to practice and learn how to type faster and with higher precision on the keyboard.

Test the game [https://keysmash.no](https://keysmash.no) or in [Matrix-mode](https://keysmash.no/?theme=matrix)
